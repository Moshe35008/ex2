hi! welcome to Sermo.

* before running the app you should update the database using "update-database".

to run the app:

1. run the "Sermo" (containing API and server)
2. run the "SermoApp" (containing the static app files and the ratings)

the "sermo react" is just a react project backup.

hope you enjoy!
